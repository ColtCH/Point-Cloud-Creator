Description: 
            Using libpcap, parses LiDAR data output from Velodyne Puck VP-16 and organizes into point cloud format.
            
Dependencies:
            C++11
            <libpcap.h>:
                  sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
            matplotlib (for debug file, non essential for compilation)
                  pip install matplotlib
                  pip install numpy
                  
File Descriptions:
            driver.cpp:
                  Location of main(). File handling of libpcap is done here.
            pointcloud.h:
                  Class prototype of PointCloud handler. Also handles C structs and conversion to LiDAR structs.
            pointcloud.cpp:
                  Implements 'pointcloud.h'.
            debug_points.py:
                  Debug function used to diagnose problems with matplotlib 3D plots.
            Sequence_Diagram.png:
                  Illustrates object relations over time throughout execution of program.
            Function_Dictionary.txt:
                  Contains detailed analysis of functions created and used in program, as well as pseudo-code.
            Future_Direction.txt:
                  Meeting notes from CI meetings.
            
To Run:
            make
            ./PCAP <name_of_.pcap_file>.pcap
            ./pcap <name_of_.pcap_file>.pcap | debug_points.py #If you want to run debug tools.
